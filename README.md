# Chord Generator

## Problem

I am trying to improve my finger skill of transitioning to different chords. I could call out random chords by myself but it would be distracting since I have to both think about the fingering and what the next chord will be.

## Solution

Create a chord generator website that randomly generates a sequence of chords to play on

## Brief Implementation Details

- v1
    - The text should be displayed prominently in the center while a queue of previously played chords are shown in a vertical carousel pattern
    - There should be a way to set how fast new chords are shown. This should be based on the BPM and time signature set
    - Generate only the Natural and Minor chords. Other more advanced chords will be for a later version
    - Should be very simple. Use TailwindCSS for UI as well as Tone.js for audio/timing
    - Create a very simple stock logo. Create using Affinity Designer. Spend only an hour on it.
